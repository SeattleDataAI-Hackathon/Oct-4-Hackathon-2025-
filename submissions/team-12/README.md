# Oct-4-Hackathon-2025-

Welcome to the Hackathon 

Welcome to the Human + AI One-Day Hackathon! 
 Date: October 4th, 2025 
 Time: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM PDT 
 Location: Bellevue City Hall 
 Theme: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) 

This workbook is your single source of truth for the hackathon. It covers everything: rules, problem statements, submissions, judging, and timelines. 

Theme: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) 

Human-in-the-Loop systems combine AI/automation with human oversight or intervention for better accuracy, ethical decisions, and real-world adaptability. 

Examples: 

A medical AI that flags potential diagnoses, but a doctor approves the final decision. 

A sustainability model predicting deforestation where experts validate the risk before action. 

Your solution must incorporate a human interaction point — data labeling, review, approvals, or decision-making. 

Problem Statements 

You may choose one of the following tracks: 

Track 1: Healthcare 

Example: (The below are for idea only, you are free to explore any unique concept with your own creativity) 

Build a solution leveraging AI + human expertise for: 

Disease diagnosis assistance 

Treatment recommendations 

Patient monitoring 

Mental health chatbots with escalation to experts 

Example: A machine learning model predicts potential diabetic complications, but a healthcare provider validates before alerting patients. 

 

Track 2: Sustainability 

Example: (The below are for idea only, you are free to explore any unique concept with your own creativity) 

 
Create solutions involving AI + human oversight for: 

Energy optimization 

Waste reduction 

Carbon footprint tracking 

Disaster response planning 

Example: A model forecasts forest fire risk, but environmental officers approve evacuation alerts after review.
