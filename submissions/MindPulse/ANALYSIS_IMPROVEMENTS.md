# MindPulse Analysis Improvements

## Problem Identified
The Claude analysis was providing:
1. **Inaccurate risk levels** - showing "moderate" for serious concerns
2. **Generic responses** - "it's okay to have ups and downs" for critical situations  
3. **Context-blind recommendations** - not addressing specific concerns

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Risk Assessment Algorithm**

**Old Logic:**
- Simple concern count
- Less sensitive to critical combinations

**New Logic:**
```python
HIGH RISK if:
- Missed medication + mood ≤3 (very low)
- 3+ concerning factors
- 2+ factors + mood ≤2 (critical)
- Missed meds + mood ≤4 + poor sleep ≤3

MODERATE RISK if:
- 2+ concerning factors
- Missed meds + (mood ≤5 OR sleep ≤5)
- Very low mood alone (≤3)
- Mood ≤5 + sleep ≤5

LOW RISK: Everything else
```

### 2. **Professional Prompt Engineering System**

Created `prompts/survey_prompts.py` with:

#### **Detailed System Prompt**
- Clinical assessment guidelines
- Evidence-based intervention principles
- Crisis identification protocols
- Severity-appropriate tone matching

#### **Context-Aware User Prompts**
- Pre-calculated risk level and concerns
- Severity assessment with specific thresholds
- Risk-specific tone instructions
- Clear formatting requirements

#### **Intelligent Fallbacks**
- Context-appropriate defaults if parsing fails
- Severity-matched messages and recommendations
- Concern-specific actionable advice

### 3. **Response Quality Examples**

#### **HIGH RISK Response:**
```
Risk Level: HIGH
Provider Contacted: ✅ True

Message: "I'm concerned about what you're sharing. When multiple aspects 
of our wellbeing are struggling - especially mood, sleep, and medication - 
it's really important to reach out for support. You don't have to face 
this alone."

Recommendations:
1. Please contact your healthcare provider or therapist today - this is important
2. If you're feeling unsafe, call 988 (Suicide Prevention Lifeline) or text HOME to 741741
3. Try to take your medication as prescribed - it's a crucial foundation for stability
```

#### **MODERATE RISK Response:**
```
Risk Level: MODERATE
Provider Contacted: ❌ False

Message: "I notice some concerning patterns in your check-in. When we're 
struggling with missed medication, it can feel overwhelming. Let's focus on 
some concrete steps to support you."

Recommendations:
1. Set up medication reminders on your phone or pair it with a daily habit
2. Reach out to a friend, family member, or therapist for support
3. Try a calming bedtime routine - avoid screens 30 minutes before bed
```

#### **LOW RISK Response:**
```
Risk Level: LOW
Provider Contacted: ❌ False

Message: "It's great that you're maintaining good self-care practices. 
Keep up this positive momentum!"

Recommendations:
1. Continue your current healthy routines - consistency is key
2. Consider what's working well and how to maintain it
3. Stay connected with your support system
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ Accuracy
- Risk levels now properly reflect severity
- HIGH risk correctly identified for serious combinations
- MODERATE and LOW properly differentiated

### ✅ Specificity
- Messages address actual concerns (medication, mood, sleep)
- No generic platitudes for serious situations
- Recommendations match identified issues

### ✅ Appropriateness
- Tone matches severity (serious for high risk, encouraging for low)
- Crisis resources for high-risk situations
- Empathetic but realistic

### ✅ Reliability
- Works even if Claude response parsing fails
- Fallbacks are context-aware
- Error handling provides appropriate defaults

## Testing Results

All scenarios tested successfully:

| Scenario | Expected Risk | Actual Risk | Provider Alert | ✅ |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----|
| Missed meds + very low mood | HIGH | HIGH | Yes | ✅ |
| 4 critical factors | HIGH | HIGH | Yes | ✅ |
| Missed meds + moderate mood | MODERATE | MODERATE | No | ✅ |
| Low mood + poor sleep | MODERATE | MODERATE | No | ✅ |
| Healthy check-in | LOW | LOW | No | ✅ |
| Minor fatigue | LOW | LOW | No | ✅ |

## Files Modified

1. **`prompts/survey_prompts.py`** (NEW)
   - Professional prompt engineering system
   - Context-aware prompt generation
   - Intelligent fallback recommendations

2. **`agents/claude_agent.py`**
   - Enhanced risk calculation algorithm
   - Integration with new prompt system
   - Better error handling with context

3. **`test_all_scenarios.py`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Validates all risk levels
   - Ensures appropriate responses

## Real-World Impact

### Before:
- User with missed medication + very low mood → "It's okay to have ups and downs"
- Risk: Moderate (should be High)
- Generic recommendations

### After:
- Same scenario → "I'm concerned about what you're sharing..."
- Risk: High ✅
- Specific crisis resources and professional help recommendations
- Provider automatically notified

**Result:** MindPulse now provides clinically appropriate, contextually accurate, and genuinely helpful mental health support that matches the severity of user situations.
