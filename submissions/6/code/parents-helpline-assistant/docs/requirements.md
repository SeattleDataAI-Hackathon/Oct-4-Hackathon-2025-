# Project Requirements

## Problem Statement

Newborns get sick a lot due to their weak immune system and especially when they start going to daycare, and often parents don't have quick access to the healthcare professionals or treatments or next steps, or experienced parents (their parents/grandparents). Often there is hours of wait line to get a human advice on Nurse helpline or appointments at the doctor's office are not always available same day or even next day or even same week, only few clinics are open on weekends. Meanwhile parents get stressed, freaking out, worried and feel helpless on how to help their babies to feel better or can they do anything. On top, most parents are working, managing the sick baby along with demanding job gets really stressful.

Parents need quick access to the healthcare advice to diagnose the healthcare issues with their babies and give them some advice on how to help their babies recover or feel better when they get sick. How can we help parents get quick access to diagnosis and next steps on treating, if possible at home or help alleviate symptoms of the kids.

## Solution

An app for above problem focusing on 0-3 years, doing following:

1. Helpful agent, warm and empathetic towards the parents and the situation they are in to help their sick babies and provide initial triage
2. It will ask the parents on the symptoms
3. Use the data to diagnose the problem
4. Verify the understanding of the issues / symptoms shared by the parent
5. Based on final symptoms that the parent approved, suggest next steps
   - Such as Monitor for Hydration
   - Monitor for change in Temp
   - Use of Tylenol
   - Use of humidifier
6. Ask if they are interested in home remedies (that needs to be approved by medical professional), then offer some pre-approved home remedies
7. Built in safety features that this advice is AI generated and need to consult the professional if above suggestions doesn't work or condition worsens
8. Same conversation is accessible by the Healthcare professional or Healthcare Institute, so their nurse or doctors have access to this conversation, they can even chat via Allegro Portal, so when parents are connected to Nurse Helpline, they have context and use the recommended treatment to provide oversight and next steps
