## 🧮 Impact Estimator Overview

- Uses **LCA (Life Cycle Assessment)** databases like *Ecoinvent*, *FAOStat*, and *EPA GHG*.
- Factors in:
  - Product type (coffee, transport, groceries, energy)
  - Brand certifications (Fairtrade, Organic, B-Corp)
  - Region-specific energy mix and logistics
- Monte Carlo simulation estimates uncertainty bands (p05–p95).
- Returns:
  ```json
  {
    "impact": {"co2e_kg": {"mean": 0.34}, "water_l": {"mean": 120}},
    "confidence": "medium",
    "explanation": [
      {"component": "milk", "co2e_kg": 0.22, "source": "Dairy_LCA_2024"},
      {"component": "coffee", "co2e_kg": 0.09, "source": "Coffee_LCA_2023"}
    ]
  }
  ```

## 🪄 Suggestion Rating System

Each suggestion is scored via an **SQS (Suggestion Quality Score)**:

```
SQS = w1·AcceptanceRate + w2·AvgRating + w3·ImpactDelta − w4·Friction
```

| Metric | Weight |
|:--------|:--------|
| Acceptance Rate | 0.35 |
| Avg Rating | 0.20 |
| Impact Delta | 0.35 |
| Friction (cost/taste/effort) | 0.10 |

This ensures that only high-impact, low-friction suggestions are prioritized for each user context.
