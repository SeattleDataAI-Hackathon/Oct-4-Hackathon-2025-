# üö® SustAIn Wildfire Project

### **AI-Powered Wildfire Damage Prediction and Resource Optimization**

---

## üß† Overview

The **SustAIn Wildfire Project** is an intelligent system designed to help emergency teams **predict wildfire damage**, **optimize resource allocation**, and ensure **data quality** for reliable decision-making.  

It integrates pre-trained models, a lightweight API, and a local database to support **real-time dispatch decisions** and continuous improvement through logged predictions.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **api_server.py** | Main API server script that serves model predictions and handles requests. It integrates the trained models to provide wildfire damage and resource forecasts. |
| **data_quality_check.py** | Script used to validate input datasets for completeness, accuracy, and consistency before feeding them into models. |
| **requirements.txt** | List of Python dependencies required to run the project. Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. |
| **damage_model.pkl** | Pre-trained model file used to predict wildfire **damage levels** based on input features such as location, vegetation, and structural data. |
| **resource_model.pkl** | Pre-trained model used to forecast **resource needs** (e.g., fire engines, ambulances, engineering teams) based on predicted wildfire severity. |
| **dispatch_predictions.db** | SQLite database storing **past prediction results** and **dispatch recommendations** generated by the models. |

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SustAIn.git
cd SustAIn
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the API server

```bash
python api_server.py
```

The server will start and expose endpoints for:

* **Damage prediction**
* **Resource recommendation**
* **Historical query** (via SQLite)

### 5. (Optional) Run data validation

```bash
python data_quality_check.py
```

This script checks data files for missing values, invalid entries, and schema mismatches.

## üß† Models

The models are serialized using **scikit-learn**:

| Model                | Purpose                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `damage_model.pkl`   | Predicts wildfire **damage severity** (e.g., low, medium, high) using structural and environmental features.    |
| `resource_model.pkl` | Suggests **optimal resource allocation** (fire, medical, engineering, animal rescue) based on predicted damage. |

These models can be **retrained** with updated data to improve accuracy.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

* **File:** `dispatch_predictions.db`
* **Type:** SQLite
* **Purpose:** Stores all **model predictions**, **resource recommendations**, and **human overrides** for audit and analysis.

You can explore it with:

```bash
sqlite3 dispatch_predictions.db
.tables
SELECT * FROM predictions LIMIT 5;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* Large files such as `.pkl` models should use **Git LFS** ([Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com)).
* Ensure consistent **input schema** for accurate predictions.
* Commit models only if they‚Äôre final; otherwise, retrain from scripts or notebooks.

Would you like me to add a **‚ÄúSample API Request/Response‚Äù** section too, showing how to call the model via `curl` or Python?
