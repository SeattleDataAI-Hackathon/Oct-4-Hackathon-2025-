Please analyze these and create a comprehensive habit loop plan that helps me build better sustainable habits.\n",

      "1. Renting a moving truck to move across the state\n",

      "   Environmental Impact: medium\n",

      "2. Printing fifty copies of the quarterly report for tomorrow's board meeting\n",
      "   Recommendation: Distribute digital copies of the report via email or a shared platform while printing only a few physical copies for those who explicitly need them.\n",
      "   Why: Switching to digital distribution significantly reduces paper, ink, and energy use, while still accommodating attendees who require printed copies. This approach minimizes waste and is cost-effective.\n",
      "   Environmental Impact: high\n",
      "\n",
      "3. I'm driving the kids to school this morning, it's about three miles away\n",
      "   Recommendation: Consider walking or biking to school with the kids if time and weather permit.\n",
      "   Why: Walking or biking eliminates carbon emissions from the car trip and provides a healthy activity for both you and the kids. For short distances like three miles, this is a practical and sustainable alternative.\n",
      "   Environmental Impact: high\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Fixing my broken phone instead of buying a new one\n",
      "   Recommendation: Proceed with the repair and consider using a certified repair service or DIY repair kit if feasible.\n",
      "   Why: Repairing your phone significantly reduces electronic waste and saves the resources and energy required to manufacture a new device. Using a certified repair service ensures quality and extends the lifespan of your device, while DIY kits can be cost-effective.\n",
      "   Environmental Impact: high\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Running the server fans at full speed to keep the room cool\n",
      "   Recommendation: Install an energy-efficient cooling system or optimize server fan settings based on temperature monitoring.\n",
      "   Why: Running server fans at full speed consumes significant energy and may not efficiently cool the room. An energy-efficient cooling system tailored to server requirements or dynamic fan speed control based on real-time temperature can reduce energy use while maintaining optimal cooling.\n",
      "   Environmental Impact: medium\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Getting iced coffee from Starbucks in their regular cup\n",
      "   Recommendation: Bring a reusable cup or tumbler for your iced coffee.\n",
      "   Why: Using a reusable cup reduces single-use plastic or paper waste and can help lower the environmental impact of your coffee habit. Many Starbucks locations even offer a discount for bringing your own cup, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective choice.\n",
      "   Environmental Impact: medium\n",
      "\n",

      "   Recommendation: Look for a water fountain nearby and use a cup or drink directly if hygienic, or reuse the bottle from the vending machine for the day and refill it instead of buying another.\n",
      "   Why: Refilling a bottle or using a water fountain reduces the need for additional single-use plastic bottles, conserving resources and lowering waste. It's an easy way to minimize your impact after forgetting your reusable bottle.\n",
      "   Environmental Impact: medium\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Getting coffee at the local café, probably my third cup today\n",
      "   Recommendation: Bring a reusable cup for your next coffee and ask the café to fill it.\n",
