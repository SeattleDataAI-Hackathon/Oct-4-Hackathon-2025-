# 🌿 SustainIQ — AI Coach for a Greener You

> A personal AI sustainability coach that helps you understand, track, and improve the environmental impact of your daily choices — from your morning coffee to your commute.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**SustainIQ** goes beyond measuring your carbon footprint — it *guides* you toward sustainable decisions using AI-powered coaching, habit tracking, and adaptive feedback.  

It combines:
- 🌍 **Real-time sustainability scoring**
- 🤖 **AI habit coaching**
- 💬 **Contextual suggestions**
- ⭐ **User feedback loops**
- 📊 **Cumulative impact dashboards**

Think of it as **MyFitnessPal for sustainability** — where every choice, big or small, counts toward a greener lifestyle.

## 🧠 Core Concept: The AI Habit Loop

Each user interaction forms a continuous feedback loop:

> **Choice → Suggestion → Rating → Decision → Feedback → Reward**

This loop allows the AI coach to understand your preferences and refine its recommendations over time — gently shaping sustainable habits through *positive reinforcement* instead of guilt.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Choice Awareness
You log or auto-sync your daily activities such as:
- ☕ Beverages (coffee, tea)
- 🚗 Commute (drive, EV, bus, walk)
- 🛒 Purchases (via bank APIs)
- 💡 Energy usage (via smart devices)

AI classifies these into sustainability-impact categories and calculates metrics like:
- **CO₂ footprint**
- **Water use**
- **Land impact**
- **Ethical sourcing**

---

### 2. Smart Suggestions

After each logged activity, SustainIQ offers a **contextual suggestion**:

> “Try oat milk next time – saves 0.4 kg CO₂ per cup.”  
> “Switch to loose-leaf tea – 70 % lower water footprint.”  

Suggestions appear at **relevant times** and adapt based on your goals, preferences, and location.

---

### 3. Decision & Feedback Loop

When you act on a suggestion, the app recognizes it and rewards you with:
- Real-time visual feedback (impact saved)
- Points, badges, or streaks
- Updated sustainability score

Example:
> “👏 You switched to organic coffee! That’s 120 liters of water and 0.25 kg CO₂ saved.”

---

### 4. Cumulative Dashboard

Track progress with:
- **Daily & Weekly Scores**
- **Top Sustainable Choices**
- **Impact Equivalence:** “You’ve saved 70 kg CO₂ — equal to 4 trees planted 🌲”
- **Category Insights:** Food, Travel, Energy, Shopping

---

### 5. Long-Term Coaching

The AI coach adapts over time:
- “You’ve made sustainable coffee choices 4 of 7 days this week — great job!”
- “Let’s aim to reduce your commute footprint by 15 % next month.”
- Celebrates streaks and milestones.

## ⭐ Suggestion Rating System

The **Suggestion Rating System** helps SustainIQ learn from real-world feedback to refine future recommendations.

### Step 1 – User Rates a Suggestion

| Input | Options |
|:------|:--------|
| Quick Rating | 👍 / 👎 or ⭐ (1–5) |
| Reason | “Too expensive”, “Hard to find”, “Taste”, “Time”, “Already do this”, “Other” |
| Remind Later | ✅ Toggle to resurface similar suggestions |

Example Prompt:
> “Was this suggestion helpful?” 👍 👎  
> “Why?” → Too expensive / Taste / Already doing it
